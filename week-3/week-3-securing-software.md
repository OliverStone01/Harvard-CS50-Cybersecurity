## CS50 Cybersecurity week 3 - Securing software

### Notes from lecture

Today we are taking a look at securing software. First let's look at phishing. Let's look at how phising is created and how someone can spot whether an email and link are phishing. 

Here is some very simple HTML that a web server would send to a web server when it want's to display a page on the browser:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  ...
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```
